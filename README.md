üìà Adani Enterprises Valuation: A Financial Modeling Showcase
This project provides a comprehensive, end-to-end financial valuation of Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT.NS) using modern data science and financial modeling techniques in Python. It's a great example of how to combine time-series forecasting, fundamental analysis (DCF), and risk modeling (Monte Carlo) to arrive at a data-driven valuation.

‚ú® Key Features
Automated Data Collection: Fetches real-time stock data directly from Yahoo Finance.
Revenue Forecasting: Utilizes an ARIMA time-series model to forecast future revenue.
Core Valuation: Implements a two-stage Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to calculate intrinsic value.
Risk Simulation: Performs a Monte Carlo simulation to model valuation uncertainty and provide a range of potential outcomes.
Visual Analysis: Includes data visualizations to make complex results easy to understand.
üìä Model Walkthrough
The analysis is broken down into four key steps within the Jupyter Notebook:

Data Collection üì•

We start by fetching historical stock prices for ADANIENT.NS using the yfinance library.

Crucially, we load historical financial data (like revenue) from the adani_ent.xlsx file, which is located in this repository.

ARIMA Revenue Forecasting üîÆ

An ARIMA(1,1,1) model is fit to the historical revenue data.

This model forecasts revenue for the next five years, which serves as the foundation for our DCF model.

Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis üí∞

This section calculates the intrinsic value of the company.

Key Assumptions:

EBITDA Margin: 25%

Tax Rate: 25%

CAPEX and Working Capital assumptions: 100 and 50, respectively.

Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): 10%

Based on these assumptions and the forecasted revenue, the model projects Free Cash Flow (FCF) and a Terminal Value.

DCF Valuation Result: The model outputs a valuation of approximately 877,914.

Monte Carlo Simulation üé≤

To address the uncertainty of a single DCF number, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation with 1,000 iterations.

The revenue growth rate is modeled as a normal distribution (mean=10%, std_dev=3%).

Each simulation generates a new valuation, and the results are plotted in a histogram to show the probability distribution of potential outcomes.
